title: Salesforce Mobile SDK Tutorial
---

In this tutorial, you use the Salesforce Mobile SDK to build different types of hybrid applications. 

This tutorial also focuses on describing strategies that provide a streamlined and flexible developer experience. For example, you'll be able to:

- Run your application on a mobile device and in your browser without code modification. Developing in the browser is generally faster and easier to debug.
- Run the same application as "Hybrid Local" and "Hybrid Remote". A Hybrid Local app has its web application installed locally (on your device), and a Hybrid Remote app has its web application served from the server. There are pros and cons for both options, but the Hybrid Local development workflow is definitely smoother. This tutorial demonstrates how to develop using the Hybrid Local model, and deploy using the model (Local or Remote) that best fits your requirements. 


A mobile device or a vendor SDK (iOS or Android) is not a requirement for this tutorial. However, if you want to run and test the application on a mobile device or in an emulator, you need the vendor SDK for the target platform installed on your computer. If you don't have a vendor SDK available on your computer, you will still be able to run the tutorial applications in your browser.
